Documentaion to Run the project 

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) should be installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org).


Front-end Setup:

1.Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.

2.Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

npm install


3.Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server by running the command:

npm start


4 .The development server will start, and the front-end application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.



Back-end Setup:

1.Open another terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's back-end directory by running the following command:

cd backend

2.Install the required dependencies for the back-end by running the following command:

npm install

3.After the dependencies are installed, start the back-end server by running the command:


npm start


4.The back-end server will start running on http://localhost:3001.



after this  we can use the project

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the project's home page.

On the home page, you will find a  toolbar with the "Home" text on the left and a login button on the right. Clicking the login button will navigate you to the /login page.

On the /login page, you will see a login form with input fields for email and password. The form validation ensures that the email field is filled correctly, and the password meets the required criteria.

After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to the search page (/search). If the login fails, a search bar notification will be displayed.

On the /search page, you will find a search input field along with a "Search" button. Enter the title of a TV show you want to search and click the "Search" button.

When the search results are received, TV show information will be displayed on  cards. The card will include the TV show's poster, name, summary, type, language, genres, status, and schedule.

If no results are found for the search query, a snack bar notification will be shown with an appropriate message.



Please note that the front-end and back-end are designed to work together, and both need to be running simultaneously for the project to function correctly.
